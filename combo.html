      The swallow may fly south with the sun, and the house martin or the plover may seek warmer climes in winter, yet these are not strangers to our land. Well, Mercia's a temperate zone! Well, we did do the nose.
      <p>And this isn't my nose. This is a false one. What a strange person. Why? The swallow may fly south with the sun, and the house martin or the plover may seek warmer climes in winter, yet these are not strangers to our land.</p>
      <p>Knights of Ni, we are but simple travelers who seek the enchanter who lives beyond these woods. Well, Mercia's a temperate zone! Well, we did do the nose. What do you mean? Well, I didn't vote for you.</p>
      <p>Well, Mercia's a temperate zone! We shall say 'Ni' again to you, if you do not appease us. Well, Mercia's a temperate zone! Oh, ow! You can't expect to wield supreme power just 'cause some watery tart threw a sword at you!</p>
      <p>How do you know she is a witch? We want a shrubbery!! Shut up! Will you shut up?! …Are you suggesting that coconuts migrate? Well, Mercia's a temperate zone!</p>

      <p>And this isn't my nose. This is a false one. The nose? Well, she turned me into a newt. …Are you suggesting that coconuts migrate? Now, look here, my good man.</p>
      <p>Well, what do you want? Well, I didn't vote for you. Well, I got better. Look, my liege! Ah, now we see the violence inherent in the system!</p>
      <p>Oh, ow! You can't expect to wield supreme power just 'cause some watery tart threw a sword at you! You don't frighten us, English pig-dogs! Go and boil your bottoms, sons of a silly person!
